# OldDaLibraryIter2

This is the second iteration of DaLibrary, a project that would later turn into
[DaLanguage](https://github.com/ChaosInventor/DaLanguage). This iteration's goal
was to simplify large parts of DaLibrary and increase their flexibility. Once
again, I was not satisfied with the result and began work on the [next and final
iteration](https://github.com/ChaosInventor/OldDaLibraryIter3) of DaLibrary.

This is an archive, I will not develop this project further.
